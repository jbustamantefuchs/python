These codes allow you to create a web interface to visualize the cameras integrated into a robot (in this case, R2D2). Additionally, they include three buttons that allow you to select or stop the control mode. They also provide a textual representation of the active control mode and the response generated by the robot through a speech-to-text system.


start_web: Python script that initiates the loading of the web interface, where it will read the actions on the page and send text or video for display on the page.

nodos: Bash script that executes or stops the control modes based on the selection made on the web page.

index: This is the index, representing how the web page looks, where the robot's camera feed is displayed, along with the text received from speech_to_text and the robot's control mode.


! To ensure that start_web works along with the index and nodes, the following folder structure must be created:


web_interface/
│
├── start_web.py
├── nodos.sh
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
└── static/
    └── images/
        └── r2d2.png  (background PNG)


! Additionally, you need to update the paths where the control mode scripts are located.
